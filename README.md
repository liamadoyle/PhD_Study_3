## About

For the third study of my dissertation, I conducted an experiment to examine (a) the relationship between psychopathy and exploitation in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) and (b) the relationship between psychopathy and success in the PDG. I also examined an important moderator of these relationships: the length of the game being played (i.e., whether the PDG was "one-shot" or iterated).

## Installation

### CSV

The .csv files with the raw and processed data can be opened in many common data processing programs, including Excel and Google Sheets. It should be noted that any potential identifiers have been removed to ensure the privacy of participants.

### R Script

Data pre-processing and statistical analysis was conducted using version 4.4.0 of *R*. The packages used for analysis are as follows: 

* version 2.0.0 of the *tidyverse* package,
* version 2.1.5 of the *readr* package,
* version 4.3.3 of the *stats* package,
* version 1.0.5 of the *broom* package,
* version 0.8.7 of the *effectsize* package,
* version 1.4-25 of the *multcomp* package,
* version 2.3.0 of the *gridExtra* package, and

## Supplemental Analyses

For readers interested in the supplemental analyses discussed in my dissertation and who are unfamiliar with the structure of GitHub, I have provided direct download links to the relevant files below. If you right-click and click "Save Link As", these links will download a local copy of these files to your computer in a target folder of your choice. Readers who do not have the necessary software to open .qmd files (i.e., *R* and an IDE, if desired) may view the code and output for the supplemental materials directly in their web browser by downloading the '.html' file.
