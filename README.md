## About

For the third study of my dissertation, I conducted an experiment to examine (a) the relationship between psychopathy and exploitation in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) and (b) the relationship between psychopathy and success in the PDG. I also examined an important moderator of these relationships: the length of the game being played (i.e., whether the PDG was "one-shot" or iterated).
